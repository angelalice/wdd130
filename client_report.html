                <p id="client_p">To determine what content to use for my site plan, I first identified 
                    my three main topics and how I could make this website as useful as possible for users,
                    even though the web page is not as dynamic as most. I also looked at various other websites
                    to see how they structured their web pages and how the flow of the content fit together. This 
                    helped me to determine how to structure my content and which pictures to use. My developer sits 
                    at my table, and she always comes to class, so we have no issues with communication. My developer 
                    met my expectations, and the next time I hire a team to do something for me, I will maintain the 
                    level of specificity I include in my site plan and wireframe so they know exactly how I want my site
                    to look. </p>

                <p id="lead_p">I used Teams to communicate with my team. I sent frequent updates to keep
                    them informed, and so they would feel comfortable reaching out to me for help. I had 
                    a hard time reaching my client and had to wait a long time to get the site plan and
                    wireframe. It took me some time to understand how to use GitHub; however, once I 
                    understood how to use it, it was a fantastic tool that allowed for easy collaboration. 
                    I was able to get a link to the site and shared it with my client so she could tell me if she liked it or not.</p>

                <p id="junior_p">There were some issues with my team leads. One of them doesn't come to 
                    class often, so it took some time to communicate with him, but once I did, 
                    it was fine. Another one of my team leads didn’t send us the site plan for a while, 
                    but once I had it, I finished the child page. I didn’t run into any issues adding to
                    the sites.</p>

                <p id="general_p">The most challenging part of this project was communicating with others
                    and waiting for their responses. If the person doesn’t choose to respond or do their 
                    part of the assignment, there isn’t much you can do. I enjoyed being creative and 
                    using all the skills I worked on over the semester. If I could do this project again,
                    I would be more assertive in asking people to do their part. I feel more confident 
                    working on real-world projects after this experience because I have developed better 
                    teamwork and communication skills.</p>
